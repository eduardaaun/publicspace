      Although Brasília has been extensively criticized for its lack of public life, brasilienses are redefining what it means to inhabit the city in ways albeit invisible to those who look at it from above. The strategies below intend to trigger reflections and conversations among designers, urban practitioners, government and community organizers in regards to the problematics and, especially, the possibilities the city and the citizens already offers.

      Architects and urban planners, both in government and academia, have systematically ignored the informal and self-organized dynamics of the city to inform land use plans and public policies. Although Brasília was planned almost 60 years ago, today it is experienced in a different way, and the new dynamics, uses and activities must also be recognized and included in urban planning. Use the strategies below to understand the new uses and activities that many spaces have not previously prescribed, but which demonstrate the interest and need of many residents. Use them to also understand what challenges groups face and how laws, policies and urban instruments could facilitate these processes.</p>

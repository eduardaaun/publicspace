      <p class="description">
       As citizens, we are entitled to many rights. The deep mobilization on the part of social movements, architects, urbanists, engineers, lawyers, universities and municipal technicians in the years that followed the military dictatorship culminated in the inclusion of the very right to the city in our Constitution. However, other than rights (which you can find in this page), as citizens we also have responsibilities. When it comes to our cities and public spaces, we are responsible for our acts, for how we treat space and neighbors. As a collective creation, the city is ultimately a reflection of our attitudes and relations.

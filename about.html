  Brazil’s recent political, social and moral crisis has shaken the country’s democracy and affected its citizens’ belief and trust in the decision-making processes that impact their lives and cities. At the same time, a recent phenomenon happening in many cities around Brazil, and particularly in Brasilia, has given rise to new forms of citizenship. It has been through the reclaiming of public spaces, for social, cultural, economic or environmental purposes that social movements, community organizations and cultural producers have been creating new spaces and new means for action, experimenting with different collective forms of democratic governance and communal decision-making.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        Whether through political manifestations and protests, artistic gatherings, cultural occupations, community gardens, markets, happenings, carnival blocks or parties, different initiatives are reinventing politics by reimagining space. By appropriating, transforming and/or reclaiming public spaces for mutual benefit, the different actors are engaging in the social practice that Harvey refers to as commoning, by which they are demanding the right to the city and redefining citizenship and participation.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        While the initiatives come in different forms and means, they all share similar purposes and outcomes. However, they are organizing organically, independently and, in many cases, disconnected from each other, and unsupported by the government. Although they have a lot to say, they don’t seem to have a voice in the future of the city.

      <p class="description">
        Under these circumstances, this platform is a part of a multiscale strategy for the democratic governance of public space. It proposes to connect and give the existing practices visibility. The intention is to synergize and coordinate a diverse movement that has an active role in shaping and inhabiting their environment, and who want to participate in the decisions regarding the city, but that don’t have a space to do so.

        Nevertheless, in the last few years, something has changed in the way the inhabitants of Brasilia have been experiencing public space. There are are many social movements, community associations and cultural producers that are challenging the notions of inhabitation of the functional city, finding new venues and means for social interaction, cultural production and political action, redefining citizenship and participation. As a response to the urban asymmetries that systemic disinvestment and social exclusion have created, to the political and economic crisis that we face today, but also of a contemporary society to premodern and  modern urbanistic concepts, there are innumerable initiatives in the city that are reimagining relationships, economies, politics and space, whether through political manifestations and protests, artistic gatherings, cultural occupations, community gardens, markets, happenings, carnival blocks or parties. Using public spaces as platforms, different actors are appropriating, transforming and/or reclaiming these spaces for mutual benefit, in what Harvey refers to as “commoning” (Harvey, 72-73, 2012), demanding among many things (even if indirectly), the right to the city: the right of creation and full fruition of social space (Levebvre, 1969).
